           <br><br><strong>What is Push ups?<br><br></strong>
           
           It’s one of the most effective and common do-at-home exercise ever. It’s quite simple to do. Get into plank position. Keep hands under bit outside your shoulder, keep your leg stretched, lower your body until chest gets near to the floor and quickly come back to original position. It basically strengthens your upper body as it’s beneficial for chest, shoulders and triceps. It also strengthens yours thighs and abdominal muscles. In the beginning, it seems difficult to do more number of pushups. You can also start with knee pushups, inclined pushups in the beginning.
           
           <br><br><strong> Benefits:</strong><br><br>

The upper body muscles that come into play in the pushup are the deltoids of the shoulders, the pectoral muscles of the chest, the triceps and biceps of the upper arm, and the erector spinae of the back. The abdominal muscles used to hold the body rigid during the pushup are the rectus abdominis and the transversus abdominis. As the pushup involves multiple joints, it is a compound exercise.<br>
In daily life, you will often need to push against objects, from doors to shopping carts. The functional fitness you develop with pushups will serve you well. Working the stabilizer muscles around the shoulders can help protect you from rotator cuff injuries. Pushups are also a measure of overall fitness, allowing you to assess whether you need to be doing more to keep your body in good working condition.<br>

           <br><br><strong>Step-by-Step Instructions:<br><br></strong>

1.Get on the floor on all fours, positioning your hands slightly wider than your shoulders.<br>
2.Extend your legs back so that you are balanced on your hands and toes. Keep your body in a straight line from head to toe without sagging in the middle or arching your back. You can position your feet to be close together or a bit wider depending on what is most comfortable for you.<br>
3.Before you begin any movement, contract your abs and tighten your core by pulling your belly button toward your spine. Keep a tight core throughout the entire pushup.<br>
4.Inhale as you slowly bend your elbows and lower yourself until your elbows are at a 90-degree angle.<br>
5.Exhale as you begin contracting your chest muscles and pushing back up through your hands to the start position. Don't lock out the elbows; keep them slightly bent.<br>

<br><br><strong>Safety and Precautions:<br><br></strong>

You should not do pushups if you have a shoulder, wrist, or elbow injury. Talk to your doctor or physical therapist to see if this is an appropriate exercise. If you want to protect your wrists, you can place your hands on dumbbells or pushup bars to keep them in a neutral position. If you feel shoulder pain during the pushup or hear a clicking noise in your shoulder, end the exercise.
