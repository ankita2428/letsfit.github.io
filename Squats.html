           <br><br><strong>What is squat?<br><br></strong>
A squat is a strength exercise in which the trainee lowers their hips from a standing position and then stands back up. During the descent of a squat, the hip and knee joints flex while the ankle joint dorsiflexes ; conversely the hip and knee joints extend and the ankle joint plantarflexes when standing up.Squats are considered a vital exercise for increasing the strength and size of the lower body muscles as well as developing core strength. The primary agonist muscles used during the squat are the quadriceps femoris, the adductor magnus, and the gluteus maximus.
[1]The squat also isometrically uses the erector spinae and the abdominal muscles, among others.
[2]The squat is one of the three lifts in the strength sport of powerlifting, together with the deadlift and the bench press. It is also considered a staple exercise in many popular recreational exercise programs.

           <br><br><strong>What are the benefits of doing squats?<br><br></strong>strong>
The list of squat benefits is lengthy, but to summarize and point out the top picks, here are seven key benefits of doing squats.
<br><br>1. Strengthens your core<br><br>
Having strong core muscles can make everyday movements like turning, bending, and even standing easier. Not only that, but a strong core can improve your balance, ease pain in your low back, and also make it easier to maintain good posture.<br><br>
2. Reduces the risk of injury<br><br>
When you strengthen the muscles in your lower body, you’re better able to execute full-body movements with correct form, balance, mobility, and posture.<br><br>
3. Crushes calories<br><br>
Calorie burning is often equated with aerobic exercises such as running or cycling. But performing high-intensity, compound movements like the squat can also crush some serious calories.<br><br>
4. Strengthens the muscles of your lower body<br><br>
Your lower body boasts some of your largest and most powerful muscles.From getting out of bed, to sitting down in a chair, your glutes, quadriceps, hamstrings, adductors, hip flexors, and calves are responsible for almost every move you make.Strength training exercises like squats can help strengthen and tone the muscles in your lower body. When these muscles are in good condition, you may find that you can move more comfortably, with less pain, and that everything from walking to bending to exercising is easier to do.<br>
5. Boosts athletic ability and strength<br><br>
If you compete in a sport, adding jump squats to your workout may help you develop explosive strength and speed which, in turn, may help improve your athletic performance<br><br>
.6. Variety helps with motivation<br><br>
Once you master the basic squat, there are many different types of squat variations you can try. Changing up your squats can help keep the exercise interesting, while also activating different muscle groups.Squats can be done with just your body weight. They can also be done with weights, like dumbbells, barbells, kettlebells, or medicine balls, or with resistance bands or yoga balls.<br><br>
7. Can be done anywhere<br><br>
To do bodyweight squats, you don’t need any equipment. All you need is your body and enough room to lower your hips into a sitting position.And, if you’re pressed for time, you can still benefit many muscle groups by doing 50 squats a day: Try doing 25 in the morning and 25 at night. As you get stronger, add 25 to the afternoon.

           <br><br><strong>Are there any risk ?<br><br></strong>strong>
According to the National Strength and Conditioning Association: “Squats, when performed correctly and with appropriate supervision, are not only safe, but may be a significant deterrent to knee injuries.” So rest easy: as long as you use proper squat form, the squat does not put your back or knees at risk of injury.
