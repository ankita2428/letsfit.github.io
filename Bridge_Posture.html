          <br> <br><strong>what is Bridge Posture?</strong><br><br>
      Lie flat your back with arms on your sides, palms down. 
    Keep feet flat on the floor with knees bended. Ensure to keep feetâ€™s apart (hip-width).
    Now, slowly lift your hip towards ceiling and hold on to the position for a while and then come 
back to original position. Bridge pose helps you get relief from lower back pain and helps you fight hypertension.   
           
          <br><br> <strong>Benefits of Bridge Pose</strong><br><br>

Bridge Pose opens the chest, heart, and shoulders. 
It stretches the spine, the back of the neck, the thighs, and the hip flexors (front hip joints).
Because your heart is higher than your head in this pose, it is considered a mild inversion 
(less strenuous than other inversions, such as Headstand) and 
           
holds all the<strong> benefits of inversions</strong>:<br> Relief from stress, fatigue, anxiety, headaches, insomnia, and mild depression.
           
Bridge Pose also calms the mind and is known to be therapeutic for individuals with high blood pressure. Because it opens the chest, it increases lung capacity, which is therapeutic for those with asthma.

          <br><br> <strong>Are there any risk ?</strong><br><br>
           
It increases blood circulation. Although the bridge posture is considered as safe, however there are few health conditions under which it can be dangerous and should only be practiced under the guidance of experienced yoga trainer.
