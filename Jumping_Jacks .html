           <strong> What are jumping jacks?</strong><br>

Jumping jacks are an efficient total-body workout that you can do almost anywhere. This exercise is part of what’s called plyometrics, or jump training. Plyometrics is a combination of aerobic exercise and resistance work. This type of exercise works your heart, lungs, and muscles at the same time.It’s important to warm up and stretch before starting the regular exercise. Jumping jack gives flexibility and help you increase the stamina. Keep your feet together and stand tall and keeping hands straight at your sides. While jumping, raise your arms above your head and feet’s apart to the sides. Quickly reverse and come back to standing position with a jump. A one or two minute jumping jack exercises can loosen your muscles with more flow of oxygen into the bloodstream. Burn some calories, get flexible and toned body with some jumping jacks exercise daily. Modify jumping jack

    <strong>Specifically, jumping jacks work your:</strong><br><br>

glutes
quadriceps
hip flexors
Jumping jacks also involve your abdominal and shoulder muscles.

Read on to learn more about the benefits of jumping jacks and how to incorporate them into your exercise routine.

What are the benefits?
Plyometric exercises, like jumping jacks, are intended to help people run faster and jump higher. That’s because plyometrics work by rapidly stretching the muscles (eccentric phase) and then rapidly shortening them (concentric phase).
<br><br>
    <strong>Other examples of plyometric exercises:</strong><br><br>

burpees
squat jumps
box jumps
lunge jumps
Jumping jacks may be a good alternative to logging miles on a treadmill or stationary bike. All of these exercises help raise your heart rate, but jumping jacks also get you to move your body out of its normal plane of motion.

By taxing the muscles in these ways, movement can become more explosive, gaining both strength and agility for sports that require multidirectional movement.

Jump training may be good for bone health, too. In one study, rats were put on a jumping exercise regimen for eight weeks (200 jumps per week with 40 jumps per day for five days).

Their bone density was measured before and after the jumping regimen and showed significant gains over the control group. The rats were able to maintain these gains over a 24-week period with training reduced to as low as 11 percent (21 jumps per week) of the initial test period.

    <strong>Regular exercise in general may also provide the following benefits:</strong><br><br>

weight management
reduced blood pressure
reduced low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, the “bad” cholesterol
increased high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, the “good” cholesterol
increased insulin sensitivity
What about calories burned?
A 150-pound person doing just a single two-minute session (approximately 100 repetitions) of jumping jacks may burn around 19 calories. Doing jumping jacks for a total of 10 minutes broken up in spurts throughout the day would burn 94 calories total.
<br><br>
    <strong>Are there any risks?</strong><br><br>
Jumping jacks and other plyometric exercises are associated with a risk of injury, especially to lower body joints like the knee and ankle. As with most exercises, the risk is higher if you don’t start out with a base level of strength and conditioning.

If you have joint issues, muscle injuries, or other health concerns, check with your doctor before starting such a program.
