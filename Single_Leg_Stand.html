           <br><br><strong>What is Single Leg Stand?<br><br></strong>
           Balancing on one feet enhances flexibility of leg muscles. It boosts your concentration, helps you stay focused that makes you fight anxiety and depression. To start with, do a basic exercise. Shift your entire body weight on one foot and lift the other slightly off the floor. Keep it straight forward and try not to lean your body. Stay in the position for a minute. You can also do yoga posture called vrikshasana that relaxes and calms the central nervous system.
           <br><br><strong>Benefits</strong><br><br>

The ability to stand on one leg is important. When walking, you spend about 40% of your time with one foot on the ground as the opposite leg is moving through the air. The single leg stance is a simple, but very effective exercise for improving balance.Improving your balance can help improve sports performance, and it may help you prevent falls that can cause serious injury.

<br><br><strong>Step-by-Step Instructions:<br><br></strong>
Before you start balance exercises, your physical therapist may want to get a baseline measurement of your balance to track your progress. Balance tests like the functional reach test or the single leg stance test can give you an idea of how well your body's balance systems are working.
<br><br><strong>To perform the single leg balance test:<br><br></strong>
Stand upright with your feet together. Remain safe while performing the test; have a stable object like a chair or kitchen counter nearby so you can grab it if you start to feel unsteady.
Lift one foot off the ground. Do not to allow your legs to touch (this may give you extra stability).
Watch a clock to see how many seconds you are able to stand on one foot and record this number.
If you are able to stand on one foot for 60 seconds or greater, try the single leg stance test while standing on a soft surface like a pillow.

<br><br><strong>Safety and Precautions:<br><br></strong>
The ability to stand on one leg is important to remain safe while walking and moving around. Adequate single leg balance may be one component of your balance rehab program. Visit your PT and learn how to safely measure your balance and perform the single leg stance balance exercise to ensure you maximize your functional mobility and stability.
Before doing this or any other exercise program for balance, check in with your doctor to be sure that the exercise is safe for you to do.
