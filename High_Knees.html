           <br><br><strong> What is High Knees?</strong>
        
           High Knees are a cardio-intensive exercise performed at a fast pace. It engages your core, strengthens all the muscles in your legs, gets your heart rate up and improves momentum, coordination and flexibility. Because of the many physical benefits, high-knees are incorporated into a wide variety of workouts. They’re also relatively easy exercises to perform because they can be practiced anywhere — no gym or equipment required.
           How do you do High Knees?
           <br><br><strong>Step 1<br><br></strong>
Stand with your feet hip-width apart. Lift up your left knee to your chest.

         <br><br><strong>  Step 2<br><br></strong>
Switch to lift your right knee to your chest. Continue the movement, alternating legs and moving at a sprinting or running pace.

           <br><br><strong> exercise to warm up the body or add to a circuit to elevate your heart rate.<br><br></strong>
Start standing with your legs hip-distance apart and as you exhale lift one leg up into a 90-degree angle towards your chest, balancing on one leg then transfer your weight to the other side, and switch. Repeat this motion back and forth for the desired amount of time/duration. The focus should be to keep the core tight, spine neutral, and the legs in line with the hips throughout.
