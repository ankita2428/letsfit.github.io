           <br><br><strong> What is Pull Ups?<br><br></strong>
Just because you don't have a pull up bar at home or access to a gym doesn't mean you can't do pull ups or work out your back! There are plenty of things you can find around your home or outside to do pull ups on instead of a bar. You can also do alternative exercises tA pullup is an upper body strength training exercise.

To perform a pullup, you start by hanging onto a pullup bar with your palms facing away from you and your body extended fully. You then pull yourself up until your chin is above the bar. Pullups are different than a chinup. With a chinup, your palms and hands face toward you.

The pullup is considered an advanced exercise. It’s more difficult than the chinup. But the pullup can be modified or done on an assisted machine for beginners, and you’ll still get benefits from these variations.

           <br><br><strong>1. Strengthen the back muscles<br><br></strong>
The pullup is one of the most effective exercises for strengthening the back muscles. Pullups work the following muscles of the back:

Latissimus dorsi: largest upper back muscle that runs from the mid-back to under the armpit and shoulder blade
Trapezius: located from your neck out to both shoulders
Thoracic erector spinae: the three muscles that run along your thoracic spine
Infraspinatus: assists with shoulder extension and is located on the shoulder blade
           
           <br><br><strong>2. Strengthen the arm and shoulder muscles<br><br></strong>
Pullups also strengthen the arm and shoulder muscles. By performing pullups regularly, you’ll work the forearms and shoulders. If you’re looking to improve your strength in these areas, you should perform pullups regularly.

If you can’t perform the full pullup, doing them assisted or just getting in the position (hanging from the bar) can increase your strength as you work up to the complete movement.


           <br><br><strong>3. Improve grip strength<br><br></strong>
Pullups also help improve grip strength. Grip strength is important if you lift weights.


           <br><br><strong>4. Improve overall body strength and fitness level<br><br></strong>
Strength or resistance training can increase your overall fitness level. When you’re performing a pullup, you’re lifting your entire body mass with the movement. This can greatly improve your body strength and even improve your health.

StudiesTrusted Source show that strength training is important for promoting bone development and enhancing cardiovascular health.

Strength train with exercises like pullups two to three times a week for best results.

           <br><br><strong>5. Improve physical health<br><br></strong>
Strength or resistance training with exercises like pullups may also improve your overall physical health. StudiesTrusted Source found that regularly performing strength training may help reduce visceral fat and help you manage type 2 diabetes.

It can also help reduce resting blood pressure and may reduce back pain and discomfort associated with arthritis and fibromyalgia.

Talk to your doctor before starting to strength train, as it may not be safe for you. The results may also vary for everyone.


           <br><br><strong>6. Improve mental health<br><br></strong>
           Strength or resistance training is also beneficial for your mental health. A 2010 review of studies found a positive correlation strength training and the following:<br><br><strong> Benifits:<br><br></strong>

reducing anxiety symptoms
improving cognitive function
reducing fatigue
reducing depression
and improving self-esteem
While the evidence seems positive, more research is needed to confirm these results.

           <br><br><strong>7. Challenge your muscles<br><br></strong>
Pullups are a challenging strength training exercise. Challenging your muscles with difficult moves can improve your overall fitness level, too. If you haven’t done pullups before, adding them to your routine may improve how strong you feel and look.

If you do the same exercises over and over, your body can start to plateau after a while. But by adding in new and challenging exercises like pullups, you may see great improvement in your strength.


           <br><br><strong>Benefits of pullup variations<br><br></strong>
           
Whether you’re new to exercise or an advanced athlete, pullups can still be beneficial for you.

You can try variations on pullups, including assisted pullups (beginners), with your knees bent (intermediate version), or even with a weight belt around your legs (advanced).

Some of the benefits of pullup variations are listed below.hat work the same muscle groups as pull ups.
