           <br><br><strong> What are Crunches?</strong>
Itâ€™s a traditional exercise for stronger abs. Lie flat on your back, knees bent with feet flat on the floor. Keep the feet apart. Hands to be kept at the base of your head with elbows pointed out. Bring up your head and shoulder off the floor using your abs and go back to the position with control.
lding your core muscles will increase your metabolism, which is key to burning fat throughout the day, even when you're not exercising. The vertical leg crunch helps improve your balance and posture by recruiting muscles along your spine. Changing up your ab routine is part of getting a full core workout, and there are variations and options to help you expand your ab exercise repertoire.

8.Begin lowering the upper body by uncurling slowly. Inhale on the downward motion. Don't allow your legs to sway, and don't let them crash back to the floor. This should be a slow and controlled descent.Keep your legs in the fixed starting position.Do 3 sets of 12 to 16 reps.<br>
