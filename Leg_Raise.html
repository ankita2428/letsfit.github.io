           <br><br><strong>What is Leg Raise?<br><br></strong>
Leg raise exercises are one of the best for abdominal areas. You just need to lie on your back, place your hands beside you, palms down. Raise your legs off the ground keeping your knees locked. Hold on to the position as long as you comfortably can and then slowly come back to original position.
           <br><br><strong> The Benefits Of Lying Leg Raises</strong><br><br>
1.Lying leg raises are touted as a killer abs exercise—because they are. But your hip flexors actually reap some major benefits of this move, says Epperly. So don't be surprised if your hips feel a bit of the burn during this one.<br>
2.Strong hip flexors will improve your runs, your spin game, and your squat, so this is a great move to add to any routine—regardless of your activity of choice, says Epperly.<br>
3.Lying leg raises can also help alleviate low back pain, she adds, since it improves the overall strength and stabilization of your core.
           <br><br><strong>Step-by-Step Instructions<br><br></strong>
1.Stand in the frame with your arms resting on the arms of the chair. Grab on to the handles of the chair, if it has them.<br>
2.Check that your arm position is firm (you need to be able to lift your bodyweight from the floor).<br>
3.Inhale as you engage your abdominal muscles to prepare for the leg lift.<br>
4.Bend your knees and raise them upward until your quads are parallel to the ground.With an engaged core, exhale as you lower your legs in a controlled movement until you're back in the starting position.<br>
5.Aim for 8 to 10 raises before resting (one set). Work up to 3 sets of 10 raises.

           <br><br><strong>Benefits</strong><br><br>
The exercise targets the abdominal muscles (rectus abdominis), hip flexors (iliopsoas), and the external obliques. It also introduces isolation techniques.<br>

In your day-to-day life, you'll engage many different muscles groups to complete tasks like climbing stairs or carrying groceries. As you participate in your activities of daily living, these muscles have to coordinate and work together. Isolation exercises such as the hanging leg raise can give you the opportunity to identify your body's unique areas of weakness and develop a workout to strengthen them.

2.Check that your arm position is firm (you need to be able to lift your bodyweight from the floor).<br>
3.Inhale as you engage your abdominal muscles to prepare for the leg lift.<br>

6.Aim for 8 to 10 raises before resting (one set). Work up to 3 sets of 10 raises.
           <br><br><strong>Common Mistakes</strong><br><br>
1.You're Arching Your Back<br>
As you perform the leg raises, keep your back straight, not arched, and pressed against the pad. Your head and neck should be steady.<br>
2.Your Core Isn't Engaged<br>
One of the keys to performing hanging leg raises with good form is engaging your core before you lift your legs. If you lift your legs before your abdominal muscles are fully engaged you're not only missing out on the toning benefits of the move, you're also putting yourself at risk for injury.<br>
3.You're Relying on Momentum<br>
The same can be said for swinging your legs or relying on momentum. Keep your movements controlled.<br>
4.You're Holding Your Breath<br>
As you engage your abdominal muscles and prepare to lift your legs, you may be tensing up so much that you forget to breathe. Timing your lifts with your breathing will help you avoid holding your breath. Remember: Your muscles need oxygen to perform optimally.

           <br><br><strong>Safety and Precautions<br><br></strong>
To perform classic hanging leg raises, you need the right equipment. Ensure that the gym where you work out has made an investment in stable, well-maintained apparatuses.<br>
If you have certain health conditions, injuries, or are recovering from surgery, it's a good idea to check with your doctor before starting an exercise routine or adding something new to your workout. Moves like hanging leg lifts require your upper body and core to do a lot of work.
