           <br><br><strong>What is Plank?<br><br></strong>
Plank exercise puts your entire body on work. It’s most vital for abdominals. Get down on the floor on your elbows and toes. Elbows should bent and directly below your shoulders. Keep the body straight while holding on to the position.
        
           <br><br><strong>Benefits</strong><br><br>
Strengthening the core is an important aspect of any workout program. Not only does a strong and solid core look good, but more importantly, it helps to stabilize, balance, and power the body during just about every other activity. Core strength is the basis for all coordinated and powerful athletic movements. A strong core can reduce stress on the joints and allow you to achieve better posture. The plank exercise can be used as the basis for a core muscle strength and stability test. The plank is more of a strength-building exercise than a cardio exercise, but by engaging a range of muscles it does boost your calorie burn a bit. How many calories burned depends on your weight and how long you hold the plank. Typically, a 150-pound individual will burn about 3 calories a minute holding a plank.

           <br><br><strong>Safety and Precautions</strong><br><br>
You should not do planks if you have a shoulder injury. If you feel shoulder pain, end the exercise. In pregnancy, there is a concern for placing stress on the abdominal wall. It may be best to modify the plank and do a side plank or an incline plank. Talk to your doctor or physical therapist to see if this is an appropriate exercise.
           <br><br><strong>Common planking mistakess<br><br></strong>


           <br><strong>Collapsing your lower back<br></strong>
Instead of compromising your lower back by dipping your butt, engage your core by imagining your belly button pulling in toward your spine. This will help keep your torso flat and, in turn, your spine safe.
<br><br>
If you want to get super technical, have a friend gently place a broomstick or yardstick on your back. The top of the stick should make contact with your head, and the bottom of the stick should rest between your buttocks.<br>

<br><br>The stick should also make contact right between your shoulder blades for proper alignment.<br><br>

Reaching your butt to the sky<br>
Planks aren’t supposed to look like Downward Dog.<br><br>

To really get your core working the way it should in the plank position, keep your back flat enough so your abs feel engaged from top (right below your sternum) to bottom (directly below your belt). Just don’t dip your tush too far toward the floor.

           <br><br><strong>Letting your head drop</strong><br><br>
While the focus may be on keeping your hips, butt, and back in the proper position, form isn’t just about your core and lower body in this move.
<br><br>
It’s important to think of your head and neck as an extension of your back. Keep your eyes on the floor, letting them rest about a foot in front of your hands, which will help keep your neck in a neutral position.

           <br><br><strong>Forgetting to breathe<br></strong>
It’s human nature to hold your breath when you’re in a strenuous position. But denying yourself oxygen can bring on dizziness and nausea, which are unpleasant at best and dangerous at worst.

          <br> <br><strong>Focusing too much on the stopwatch<br></strong>
Quality trumps the quantity of seconds ticking away. When your form begins to suffer, it’s time to call it quits. If your back starts to bow or your shoulders start to sink, take a break.
