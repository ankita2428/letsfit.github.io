<br><br><strong>What is Hand In And Out Breathing?<br><br></strong>

           <br> <i>Physiology</i><br>
Our lungs are as important to exercise as are our muscles, bones, and tendons. The oxygen we inhale is used to convert the calories we consume into the energy that fuels exercise. This process is referred to as metabolism.
When your oxygen supply exceeds your oxygen needs, you are said to be in an aerobic state. In short, you have plenty of oxygen to fuel exercise as long as there are calories there to burn.
On the other hand, if your oxygen needs fall short of your oxygen supply, you fall into an anaerobic state. When this happens, the body, deprived of oxygen, will turn to stored fuel in muscles known as glycogen. While this can deliver a powerful burst of energy, the fuel is quickly spent; fatigue and exhaustion will soon follow.
To the end, increasing the flow of air in and out of the lungs can prevent early exhaustion and help you burn calories more effectively along the way.

           <br><br><strong>Benefits<br><br></strong>
Optimal breathing actually starts at infancy. If you ever look at a baby breathing, you will notice that the child's belly will rise and fall. This action facilitates respiration by alternately pushing and pulling the diaphragm (the muscle the separates the lungs and abdominal cavity).
When the baby inhales, the belly will extend, pulling the diaphragm downward and allowing the lungs to fill with air. When the babe exhales, the belly will pull in, pressing the diaphragm upward and forcing air out of the lungs.
As we get older and the capacity of our lungs increases, we will shift from belly-breathing to chest-breathing (involving the muscles of the chest wall rather than the diaphragm). While chest-breathing usually provides enough air for everyday activity, it doesn't fill the lungs all that fully. It is why we resort to mouth-breathing or gasping when our oxygen supply runs short.
